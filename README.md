As the google Spreadsheet API V3 comes close to depreciation (march 2020) I have developed this plugin using Google Spreadsheet API V4.  
  
It contains 2 steps :  
* Pentaho Google Sheets Input : Reads specified fields a google spreadsheet  
* Pentaho Google Sheets Output : Writes a google spreadsheet  
  
## Installation  
In *delivery rep* you will find a zip that you can unzip in your *pentaho/design-tools/data-integration/plugin* folder.  
Otherwise :  ``` mvn install ```  
You should generate your client secret file (json) for your **Google service account** and paste it somewhere on your machine (or server).  
Google Tokens will also be create in *.kettle* directory */tokens*  
The service account should be parameterized with both Google Drive and Google Spreadsheet  API’s read and write access  
  
## Input step  
### Service Account Tab  
Lets you pick your google service account client secret json file.  
Test button Lets you test your access to the API.  
On success you should see a success message.

### Spreadsheet tab  
Let’s you specify or browse for spreadsheets existing in the service account drive or for the ones that are shared with the service account email.

### Fields tab  
Lets you select from the fields of the sheet.  
Fields name are always defined in the first line of the google spreadsheet.  
* Get Fields* lets you get fields and guess their types, format, precision, decimal and group delimiter as well as trim type.

## Output step  
Lets you write data into a sheet (existing or not)  
**IMPORTANT NOTE** : The API writes data in a "user entered mode" as if you were typing in the cells. That means the cells are interpreted by google after insert. I noticed that it is better to transmit STRINGS to the step so Google Sheets works well, specially numbers. Use *Select Value* step for this  
  
### Service Account Tab  
Lets you pick your google service account client secret json file.  
Lets  you test your access to the API. On success you should see the following screen  
  
### Spreadsheet tab  
  
* Spreadsheet key :   
Lets you specify or browse for spreadsheets existing in the service account drive or for the ones that are shared with the service account email.  
If you type in a sheet name (that does not exist in the drive) it will attempt to create a sheet it the "create" checkbox is ticked.  
* Worksheet Id : Should be browsed form the selected spreadsheet key. If you want to create a new file, type in any key that will become the name of the worksheet in the created spreadsheet  
  
* Append checkbox :   
Appends the lines **without the header** to an existing spreadsheet. This is incompatible with the *create* option below.  
  
* Create sheet if it does not exist checkbox :   
If the checkbox is checked then if the Spreadsheet Key specified in the field Spreadsheet key does not exist it will create a new spreadsheet within the service account drive (note that this account has no UI)  
  
* Share with email :   
That is why the Share with user email field let’s you specify the email of a user who will get full rights on the freshly created file.  
  
* Domain Wise Permission :   
Enables to share with your whole domain (if configured in Google Drive). For security concerns I share only with READ rights.

All steps inbound fields are written in the output file  
  
## Metadata injection.  
Both steps fully support *metadata injection* and *parameters*  
See mi-input-output transformations in the sample repository.
